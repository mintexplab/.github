Hello! Welcome to the minty's experiment lab GitHub page. To start, minty's experiment lab is a multi-platform software/game development "company" founded in mid-2022 by Canadian music producer BudgieMint (me). I started minty's experiment lab after messing with Apple's Automator tool on my recently acquired MacBook Pro. I later moved on AppleScript but never actually got to making my own code (yeah unoriginal I know). I've been switching to alternate methods of app/site development, most of my websites are made with Quarkly (amazing React website maker) or hand-coded by me in WebStorm (ILY JetBrains). I have developed a ton (and I mean a ton) of software since then, don't ask why cause I don't know either. 

Currently active minty's experiment lab projects.

As surprising as it might sound (especially in this day and age). minty's experiment lab supports 🏳️‍🌈 cause I'm not as crazy as Mark Zuckerberg (booooooo 🤦)
