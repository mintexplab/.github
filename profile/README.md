Hello! Welcome to the minty's experiment lab GitHub page. To start, minty's experiment lab is a multi-platform software/game development "company" founded in mid-2022 by Canadian music producer BudgieMint (me). I started minty's experiment lab after messing with Apple's Automator tool on my recently acquired MacBook Pro. I have developed a ton (and I mean a ton) of software since then, don't ask why cause I don't know either. 

Currently active minty's experiment lab projects.
